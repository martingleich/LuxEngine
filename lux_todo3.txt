Material reworks:
	It should be possible to replace all material parameters with textures.
		-> Add texture arguments for emmisivity, specular hardness, specular intensity, and just use the sum of both.
	
	Seperate better between shader and fixed function shader.
		-> Handle scene parameters directly in shader, i.e. Set matrizes directly in the shader, via DeviceStateD3D9
		
	Better caching for shader parameters.
		->? Save state of some registers in DeviceStateD3D9, for the matrizes since these are the biggerst memory users.
		
	Generell system, make meshes, texture, kind of constant.
		Currently most system can't handle if meshes are changed while holding pointers to them.
		Maybe constant marker for some classes(mesh, geometry, etc.), which says this object will never change again.
